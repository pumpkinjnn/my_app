# README
This project is developed using Ruby on Rails and deployed using Heroku. The major langue used in the project is (embedded) ruby and html, with a small touch of Javascript. The database is supported with PostgreSQL. And the tests are power by minitests. This project is a personal website that hosts some of the handy utilities, as well as links; it is the result of my effort for CSC-324 class in Grinnell College.
